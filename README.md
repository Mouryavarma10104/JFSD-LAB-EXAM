# Department Hibernate Criteria Query Language Workspace

## Overview

This workspace is designed to explore and implement *Hibernate Criteria Query Language (HCQL)* for managing and querying data in the Department entity. HCQL provides a programmatic, type-safe, and dynamic way to construct queries, making it ideal for handling complex data retrieval tasks.

## Features

- *Dynamic Query Building*: Define flexible queries without hardcoding SQL.
- *Filtering and Sorting*: Apply conditions and sort results based on department attributes.
- *Projections*: Retrieve specific columns instead of the entire entity.
- *Pagination*: Handle large datasets efficiently by implementing pagination.
- *Type Safety*: Leverage type-safe queries for better maintainability and error reduction.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- Hibernate ORM framework (version 5 or later).
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management.

## Key Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your pom.xml or build.gradle file:

xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>5.x.x</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
    <version>5.x.x</version>
</dependency>


## Setup Instructions

1. *Configure Hibernate*:  
   Update the hibernate.cfg.xml or application.properties with your database connection details.

2. *Create the Department Entity*:  
   Define the Department class and annotate it with Hibernate mappings.

   java
   @Entity
   @Table(name = "department")
   public class Department {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private Long id;

       @Column(name = "name")
       private String name;

       @Column(name = "location")
       private String location;

       // Getters and Setters
   }
   

3. *Implement Criteria Queries*:  
   Use the Hibernate CriteriaBuilder and CriteriaQuery classes to build queries.

   Example: Retrieve all departments in a specific location.

   java
   CriteriaBuilder cb = session.getCriteriaBuilder();
   CriteriaQuery<Department> cq = cb.createQuery(Department.class);
   Root<Department> root = cq.from(Department.class);
   cq.select(root).where(cb.equal(root.get("location"), "New York"));
   List<Department> departments = session.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
   

4. *Test the Queries*:  
   Use a testing framework or a simple main method to validate your criteria queries.

## Example Use Cases

1. Fetch all departments sorted by name.
2. Retrieve departments located in a specific region.
3. Get the count of departments in each location.
4. Perform advanced filtering using multiple conditions.
